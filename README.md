Digital Ink Studies Background
==============================

Background
----------

A common method to assess cognition is the use of the [Mini-Mental State
Examination](https://www.uml.edu/docs/Mini%20Mental%20State%20Exam_tcm18-169319.pdf)
(MMSE). This creates a global score of cognition and can show. The
simplicity of the test and ease of administration make this a popular
assessment tool for research and clinical use cases. The testing
consists of about 10 questions asked verbally and two writing tasks.
This project focuses on the writing task of the test. The MMSE writing
task is two questions that are simple: “Write any complete sentence.”,
and to copy a figure on a piece of paper. These tests are scored by a
trained research assistant as to be correct (1) or incorrect (0). With
the use of new technology, it is my hope that we can access more minute
cognitive impairment and get at much greater detail in metrics instead
of the binary score. This project examines the feasibility of using a
digital pen to capture and score the previously analogue format into a
digital representation. This is done with little change to
administration of the test, the only difference in the digital format is
the pen and paper given to the participant.

Equipment
---------

Digital collection of MMSE data is completed using an [Anoto Live Pen
2](https://cloud.anoto.com/dl/y9SjE9NsHD) and printed paper with a
special imperceptible dot pattern that the pen scans with a small camera
near the tip. This then in translated into the coordinates of writing on
the paper. Other metrics taken from the pen are force on the tip and
time data.

Each administration of the MMSE tests results in one text file separated
into *strokes* each stroke has many *points* that are basically 4
measures for *x, y, timestamp and force. *

*Sample text files:*

### Project Details:

 Java Program
=============

The core of the system is used to segment the pen data and store
results. The system loads the file and uses a clustering algorithm to
make the segmentation process easier for the user.:

### Main Interactions

-   Login

-   Show segmentation tools

-   Add files to tool

-   Segment files into Sentence, Figure, RA data

    -   Flag file

    -   Remove file from tool (stays in work bin, logs)

    -   Reset work done

-   Add meta-data

    -   Project Id

    -   Tester Id date

-   Save

### Login screen. 

1.  The login details are retrieved from the SQL database connection

    a.  Login detail located at [Login Details](#login-details)

### Main View

#### Overview of main screen.

![image](media/smart_ink_main-1.PNG)

1.  ***Menu Bar for options***.

![image](media/smart_ink_menu1.PNG)

File holds open file select that open file selection dialogue

This only will load files with txt extensions

![image](media/file_selection.PNG)

If user loads a file that is a txt but not the correct file an alert
will appear.

#### Login and file info

Shows the username, file time and file location of loaded file

![image](media/smart_ink_main-1.PNG)

#### User input for scored file

This takes the user input for the user to type in for the scoring file.

#### User Controls

> Buttons for the user to rotate the drawing, cluster the strokes and
> save. Also hold controls for changing clustering
>
> ![image](media/smart_ink_main-rotate.PNG)

#### Table View

Tab view for viewing the stroke and cluster data, cluster is empty until
the cluster button is pressed

Highlighting individual stroke

![image](media/smart_ink_main-cluster1.PNG)

Cluster Button pressed to cluster strokes, the sliders in the control
column can change the clustering. In order to increase the amount of
strokes allowed in each cluster. The goal is to segment each sentence,
pentagon and ra data into as few clusters as possible, but it just makes
the segmentation easier.

![image](media/smart_ink_main-cluster1.PNG)

This demonstrates the increasing min distance slider and re-clustering.

![image](media/smart_ink_main-cluster2.PNG)

Selection of cluster will highlight all strokes in that cluster

![image](media/smart_ink_main-cluster3.PNG)

Set the segmentation labels by clicking of the label cell in the cluster
table view

![image](media/smart_ink_main-cluster4.PNG)

**Once complete press the SAVE BUTTON**

If there is a missing label set the application will alert the use and
not save.

![image](media/smart_ink_main-save1.PNG)

Upon completion the User is alerted and asker to continue scoring or
quit

The output is saved in a csv format. In the save directory as the loaded
txt file and has same base filename with .csv extension.
